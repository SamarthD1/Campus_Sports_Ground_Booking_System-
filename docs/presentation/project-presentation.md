**Backend (Node.js + MongoDB):**
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │───▶│   Express API    │───▶│   MongoDB       │
│   (Firebase)    │    │   Server         │    │   Atlas         │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```
